# Why?

2x? 1x? Doesn't matter? 3x? A lot of _(useless ;) )_ discussions and opinions. Here - only numbers and graphs.

# How to
## Manually
Enter front and back cassette sizes (separated by ___, - : ;___), 
add (optional) set name. 
Adding one or more set to the list draws all tables and graphics.

## Semi-Automatically 
Sets to compare could be encoded in URL. E.g., visiting:
[https://whatratio.com/?sets=grx%20400_f-30,46_b-32,28,25,22,20,18,16,14,12,11;SRAM%20Apex%201_f-40_b-11,12,13,15,17,19,21,24,28,32,38,44](https://whatratio.com/?sets=grx%20400_f-30,46_b-32,28,25,22,20,18,16,14,12,11;SRAM%20Apex%201_f-40_b-11,12,13,15,17,19,21,24,28,32,38,44)


Would display a comparition of **grx 400** _30-46_ ✕ _32-28-25-22-20-18-16-14-12-11_ 
and **SRAM Apex 1** with _40_ ✕ _44-38-32-28-24-21-19-17-15-13-12-11_
